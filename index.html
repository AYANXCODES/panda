        <p>Title: "Panda Pandemonium"

        Scene 1:
        [INT. ZOO - DAY]
        Pandas attempt yoga but flop comically. One panda gets stuck in a tree while sneezing, causing a chain reaction of falling bamboo.
        
        Scene 2:
        [EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - AFTERNOON]
        Pandas engage in a clumsy game of hide-and-seek, hiding behind too-small trees.
        
        Scene 3:
        [INT. PANDA NURSERY - EVENING]
        Baby pandas have a bubble bath, turning it into a playful bubble fight.
        
        End.</p></div>
    <div><img src="panda.jpg" alt=""><p>Pandas express love through gentle gestures, like nuzzling and grooming each other amidst serene bamboo groves. Mates share a bond, often seen cuddling and playfully rolling together. During mating season, males compete for females' attention, showcasing strength and agility in elaborate displays. Their devotion endures, fostering a harmonious panda family.</p></div>
    <div><img src="pandadp.jpg" alt=""><p>In the lush jungle, pandas thrive amidst bamboo thickets. They lazily munch on bamboo shoots, occasionally engaging in playful tumbles. Mothers tenderly care for their cubs, teaching them to climb trees. Occasionally, they encounter other forest dwellers like playful monkeys or snoozing bears, adding variety to their peaceful existence.
